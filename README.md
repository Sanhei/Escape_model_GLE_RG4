# Escape_model_GLE_RG4
## Purpose
As a subproject of my master thesis, in this part, we will discuss the model without recrossing, which is known as the escape model or Kramers problem.

## Integrator
The modified model uses Runge-Kutta's fourth order. We validate the model by free energy plotting

and Memory kernel extraction:

# Usage
Check loop.sh


Kramers escape time, a similar problem, with the Generalized Langevin Equation. 

The model is created in model.py.
